Its architecture comprises transaction processing, verification, and asset bridging components. Transaction processing involves a sequencer and a Layered Virtual Machine (LVM), optimizing transaction handling and computational efficiency. Transaction verification, managed by provers and challengers, ensures transaction validity and compliance with network rules. They collaborate to complete the entire process from Layer 2 transaction handling to Layer 1 confirmation, maintaining transaction security and integrity throughout the process. Bitlayer\'s assets bridge components further enhance its capabilities by enabling interoperability between Layer 2 and Layer 1 networks, facilitating secure asset transfer across blockchain layers.","sidebar":"docs"},"BitlayerArchitecture/LVM":{"id":"BitlayerArchitecture/LVM","title":"Layered Virtual Machine (LVM)","description":"Layered Virtual Machine (LVM) technology represents a significant advancement in terms of smart contract execution. This innovative approach enables the support of various frontend smart contract types, such as EVM/CairoVM, and backend zero-knowledge proof verifiers, including ZK-STARKs and ZK-SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK, etc.), while maintaining robust security measures and enhancing computational flexibility.","sidebar":"docs"},"BitlayerNetwork/Bridges":{"id":"BitlayerNetwork/Bridges","title":"Bridges","description":"Bridges play a crucial role in connecting Bitlayer with other blockchain networks, enabling seamless interoperability and cross-chain asset transfers.
