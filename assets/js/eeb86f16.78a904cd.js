At the same time, Bitlayer extends Bitcoin\u2019s functionality by introducing Turing-complete programmability, enabling developers to create complex decentralized applications and smart contracts that were previously impossible within Bitcoin\u2019s native framework. Built on the groundbreaking BitVM paradigm, Bitlayer brings smart contract capabilities to Bitcoin in a way that respects its foundational principles, while also being fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to seamlessly migrate applications and tools from Ethereum to Bitlayer without significant modifications. This unique combination of Bitcoin\u2019s security, Ethereum\u2019s programmability, and the scalability of rollup architecture positions Bitlayer as more than just a scaling solution\u2014it is a platform that reimagines Bitcoin\u2019s potential, empowering users and developers to unlock new possibilities in decentralized finance, trustless systems, and scalable infrastructure, all while staying grounded in the core ethos of Bitcoin."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(i.h3,{id:"bitlayer-vision",children:"Bitlayer Vision"}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Bitlayer's mission is to scale Bitcoin while preserving its core principles of decentralization and security.
