When Layer 2 begins, validated organizations can join the federation by depositing a specific amount of BTC. As the Layer 2 network progresses, the federation dynamically adjusts and increases its membership to boost security and decentralization. Within the cross-chain bridge, the BitVM Federation collectively manages decentralized asset custody for the BitVM bridge channel, attaining a 1 of (N) security level, meaning only one honest node is needed for network integrity. Moreover, the BitVM Federation functions as an oracle network for the OP-DCL bridge channel, requiring only some members to agree ((t) of (N)) to produce a legitimate oracle signature."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"2-dlc-components",children:"2.

Because DLC requires predefined CETs to determine the withdrawal amount, supporting fine-grained CETs is necessary to meet user-friendly withdrawal requirements. The first function of the DLC component is to facilitate the creation of funding transactions, where the assets are initially output to a 2 of 2 multi-sig output, with the parties involved being the user and the BitVM Federation ((N) of (N)) address.

The bridge smart contract manages the issuance and destruction of BTC assets on Layer 2. The light client contract maintains Bitcoin block header information on Layer 2, and Bitlayer uses ZKP-based Bitcoin state proofs to update and maintain the block header information. The light client contract also provides a Verify function to validate Bitcoin transactions, by submitting a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proof of the transaction to the light client contract to verify the legitimacy of the Bitcoin transaction.

Whenever there is a bridge transaction, the relayer forwards it to a smart contract (peg-in) or a BitVM Federation node (peg-out) for further processing.
