# Bitlayer

## introduction to Bitlayer
Bitlayer is the first Bitcoin security-equivalent layer 2 based on BitVM. It consists an EVM compatible chain that can map BTC ecological assets and facilitate the entry of BTC users.

## Bitlayer’s Value Propositions
Due to the technical nature of Bitcoin, there exists a trade-off between "security and Turing completeness" for Bitcoin layer2 solutions.

Bitlayer aims to resolve this dilemma and realize a Bitcoin layer 2 that is equally secure as Bitcoin and Turing complete through cryptographic innovations and blockchain protocol engineering. This is intended to ultimately foster a prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Technical Features
Bitlayer's core objective is to address the trade-off between security (trustless) and Turing completeness in BTC Layer 2. Based on this context, three key tasks are abstracted:
1. Trustless entry and exit of L1 assets
2. State transitions using a Turing-complete L2 virtual machine
3. L1 verification of the validity of L2 state transitions

Bitlayer innovatively utilizes the DLC/LN protocol to enable trustless bidirectional flow of signals/assets. It introduces VMs (EVM, SolanaVM, MoveVM, etc.) to support a wide range of state transition expressions.

## Vision & Architecture

Bitlayer aims to implement BitVM to validate L2 state transitions on Bitcoin L1 using an Optimistic Rollup approach. The project plans to achieve a trustless and Turing-complete BTC L2 through several iterative phases.
