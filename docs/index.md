# Bitlayer

## Introduction to Bitlayer
Bitlayer is the first Bitcoin security-equivalent layer 2 based on BitVM. It consists an EVM compatible chain/sequencer that can map BTC ecological assets and facilitate the entry of BTC users.

## Bitlayer’s Value Propositions
Due to the technical nature of Bitcoin, there exists a trade-off between "security and Turing completeness" for Bitcoin layer2 solutions.

Bitlayer aims to resolve this dilemma and realize a Bitcoin layer 2 that is equally secure as Bitcoin and Turing complete through cryptographic innovations and blockchain protocol engineering. This is intended to ultimately foster a prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Technical Features
Bitlayer's core objective is to address the trade-off between security (trustless) and Turing completeness in BTC Layer 2. Based on this context, three key tasks are abstracted:

1. Trustless entry and exit of L1 assets
2. State transitions using a Turing-complete L2 virtual machine
3. L1 verification of the validity of L2 state transitions

Bitlayer innovatively utilizes the DLC/LN protocol to enable trustless bidirectional flow of signals/assets. It introduces VMs (EVM, SolanaVM, MoveVM, etc.) to support a wide range of state transition expressions.


## About Us
The sophisticated public blockchain development and ecosystem construction team, hailing from Huobi, Polygon, and Polkadot, boasts years of practical experience in leading public blockchains and has achieved top-notch industry results.

The product research and development team possesses comprehensive experience in full-stack blockchain development and operations. They have initiated 3 EVM-compatible chains, 2 Ethereum zk-rollups, and 1 MPC+AA self-custody platform, along with various core application protocols, accumulating a total TVL (Total Value Locked) of over 14 billion and a daily transaction volume exceeding 4 million.

The ecosystem construction team has rich global resources in web3 application project developers across more than 20 countries, with over 6 years of extensive experience in early-stage Polkadot and Polygon ecosystem development. They have led the integration of hundreds of ecosystem projects onto public blockchains and have experience in strategic collaborations with dozens of leading large enterprises in the blockchain space.

Thanks to the rich experience and resources of the core team and early-stage investment incubators in the industry, the team possesses strong capabilities in achieving results in areas such as research and development, business operations, capital, channels, and community support.
