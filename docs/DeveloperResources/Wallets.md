## In-app Wallets
In-app wallets activate when users log into an app, functioning as embedded wallets without the need for a browser extension. Bitlayer supports the following in-app wallets:

- [Arcana Wallet](https://docs.arcana.network/concepts/anwallet/) - A non-custodial, in-app wallet that is accessible to authenticated users through the apps integrated with the [Arcana Auth SDK](https://docs.arcana.network/auth/). Once activated, the wallet interface includes preset EVM and non-EVM chains, enabling instant blockchain transaction signing. Explore the [supported chains](https://docs.arcana.network/web3-stack/chains/) and [quick start guides](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/) for further details.

## Networks Supported

- EVM Networks (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain)
- Bitcoin Testnet (for testing and development purposes)
- Bitcoin Mainnet (for real Bitcoin transactions)

*Choosing the right network is essential for your transactions. The Testnet is ideal for practice and development, while the Mainnet is used for actual transactions.*
