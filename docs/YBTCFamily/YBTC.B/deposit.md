# How to Deposit?

##  Target Users
This section is intended for users who wish to deposit their **YBTC.B** or **BTC** assets into the Vault to earn **BTC-denominated yield**. It applies to **all supported blockchains** (e.g., Sui, Avalanche, Plume, Starknet) and both Vault types (DeFi Vault and CeDeFi Vault).

---

##  Asset Options

You may deposit using either of the following:

### - YBTC.B
- Requires **token approval** before deposit (default is unlimited).
- Upon deposit, users receive a **Vault Proof Token** (e.g., `AvaxYBTC.B`) representing their share.
- Initially, deposits are **1:1**, but the rate updates after each **yield distribution**.

### - Bitlayer Native BTC
- **No approval needed**.
- BTC is **automatically converted** to YBTC.B during the deposit process.
- Converted YBTC.B is then deposited into the selected Vault.

##  Step-by-Step Guide

1. Visit the **official Vault platform** or a supported **partner interface**.
2. Select the **Vault product** you want to participate in.
3. Choose the asset to deposit: **YBTC.B** or **Bitlayer BTC**.
4. (Optional) Click `[Max]` to autofill the max depositable amount:

# How to Determine Ownership?

##  Proof Token: Vault Ownership Certificate

###  Functions:

- Sole certificate for redeeming original BTC (or YBTC.B) + interest.

Proof Tokens are named by chain:
- `SuiYBTC.B`

- `PlumeYBTC.B`
- `StarkYBTC.B`
