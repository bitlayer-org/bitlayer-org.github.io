# How It Works: Yield Generation Mechanism

When users deposit BTC assets (in the form of **YBTC.B**) into the Vault, the protocol — either directly or through trusted partners — allocates these funds into a diversified set of yield strategies. These strategies are designed to generate **BTC-denominated returns**, which are later distributed back to users as principal plus interest upon completion of the yield cycle.

## Primary Sources of Yield

### On-chain DeFi Strategies

Yield is generated through participation in DeFi primitives such as:

- Liquidity provisioning on DEXs (AMMs)
- Lending/borrowing spreads
- Yield farming and reward token incentives

### Off-chain Quantitative Strategies

BTC capital is deployed into market-neutral or low-risk trading strategies such as:

- Spot-futures arbitrage
- Delta-neutral hedging using perpetuals or options
- Funding rate capture in centralized or decentralized derivative markets

### Fixed-income Structured Products

In cooperation with **real-world asset (RWA)** protocols (e.g., Plume), capital may also be invested in:

- Tokenized short-term treasury notes
- On-chain fixed-rate bond-like instruments
- Time-locked principal-protected products with predictable BTC returns
