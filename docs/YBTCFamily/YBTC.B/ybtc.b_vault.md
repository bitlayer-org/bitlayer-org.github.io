# What is the YBTC.B Vault?

The **YBTC.B Vault** is an on-chain yield strategy container designed around **YBTC.B**, a cross-chain wrapped version of native BTC on Bitlayer. It allows users to deposit their YBTC.B assets into structured Vault products and earn yield denominated in BTC — either through on-chain DeFi mechanisms or through off-chain yield-enhancing strategies.

## Purpose and Design

The Vault is a core component of **Bitlayer’s BTC yield product suite**. It is engineered to serve diverse user profiles by offering two primary types of strategies:

- **DeFi Vaults**: On-chain, automated strategies utilizing lending, AMMs, and LP incentives across multiple public blockchains.
- **CeDeFi Vaults**: Hybrid strategies combining centralized and decentralized finance elements, primarily involving delta-neutral hedging, arbitrage, and structured note participation managed by trusted partners.

By depositing YBTC.B into the Vault, users gain **passive BTC-denominated income** without needing to sell, wrap, or transfer their BTC assets into other volatile tokens — thereby preserving BTC exposure while gaining yield.

## Multi-chain Compatibility

The YBTC.B Vaults are designed for **multi-chain deployment**, with current and upcoming integrations on:

- **Sui** (Move-based high-throughput chain)
- **Avalanche** (EVM-compatible L1)
- **Plume** (RWA-focused L1)
- **Starknet** (ZK-rollup Layer 2 on Ethereum)

This design enables users to engage with BTC-native DeFi strategies across ecosystems — greatly expanding the utility of BTC in decentralized finance.

---

## How It Works

Users deposit **YBTC.B** into a Vault smart contract. The protocol, or a designated strategy partner, then allocates these assets into specific strategies based on the Vault type:

- **On-chain DeFi strategies**: yield farming, lending spreads, AMM-based LP rewards  
- **Off-chain CeFi strategies**: basis trading, delta-neutral hedging, structured debt products

The system tracks user ownership and earnings via **proof tokens**, which represent a proportional share of the Vault’s assets and returns.

## Supported Assets

- The Vault accepts deposits in either **Bitlayer Native BTC** or **YBTC.B** (its cross-chain wrapped form).
