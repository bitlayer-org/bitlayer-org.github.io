## Purpose

YBTC.B is engineered with the following core objectives:

### 1. Make BTC Programmable and Usable  
Unlock the value of native BTC by making it accessible and composable across DeFi protocols spanning multiple chains.

### 2. Create a Unified BTC Liquidity Standard  
Whether on Sui, Avalanche, Plume, Starknet or any other chains, YBTC.B represents a **1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset**—backed and redeemable on demand.

### 3. Serve as a Cross-chain DeFi Hub Asset  
Acts as the liquidity medium connecting native Bitcoin with **yield-generating strategies (Vaults)**, **lending protocols**, **AMMs**, and **staking infrastructures** across chains.
