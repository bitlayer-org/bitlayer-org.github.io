# YBTC.B: Cross-chain Wrapped Native BTC Asset

## Overview

**YBTC.B** is a wrapped version of Bitlayer's Native BTC, designed to function as a universal cross-chain liquidity standard across both EVM and non-EVM chains. It enables users to deploy native Bitcoin liquidity seamlessly within DeFi ecosystems on multiple networks.

---

## Purpose

YBTC.B is engineered with the following core objectives:

### 1. Make BTC Programmable and Usable  
Unlock the value of native BTC by making it accessible and composable across DeFi protocols spanning multiple chains.

### 2. Create a Unified BTC Liquidity Standard  
Whether on Sui, Avalanche, Plume, Starknet or any other chains, YBTC.B represents a **1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset**—backed and redeemable on demand.

### 3. Serve as a Cross-chain DeFi Hub Asset  
Acts as the liquidity medium connecting native Bitcoin with **yield-generating strategies (Vaults)**, **lending protocols**, **AMMs**, and **staking infrastructures** across chains.

---

## Key Features

- **1:1 Peg to Native BTC**  
  Each YBTC.B token is fully backed by a corresponding amount of native BTC, either bridged or locked on-chain, and is redeemable at any time.
  
- **Multi-chain Yield Bearing**  
  YBTC.B can be deposited into **DeFi and CeDeFi Vaults** across multiple chains to earn BTC-denominated yield. Strategies include LP farming, lending, and fixed-income RWAs, with automated reward compounding and flexible redemption mechanisms.

- **Cross-chain Composability**  
  YBTC.B can move freely between **Bitlayer**, **EVM-compatible chains** (e.g., Avalanche, Plume), and **non-EVM chains** (e.g., Sui, Starknet), ensuring fluid capital mobility.

- **Unified Asset Format**  
  Regardless of the destination chain, YBTC.B maintains a **consistent token logic and peg structure**, simplifying wallet and protocol integration.

## Token Origin & Minting

### Underlying Asset  
YBTC.B is derived from **Bitlayer Native BTC**, which itself is **backed 1:1 by off-chain BTC** reserves.

### Minting Mechanism  
YBTC.B is minted through **verified smart contracts** when users bridge BTC into Bitlayer and initiate wrapping via the official bridge infrastructure.
