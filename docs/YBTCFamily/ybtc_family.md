# The YBTC Family

- **Bitlayer Native BTC**: The native, Bitcoin-pegged asset for Bitlayer Network V1. It is integrated directly at the protocol level, functioning as a first-class system currency similar to ETH on Ethereum or BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet, rather than as a traditional ERC-20-style token.
- **YBTC.B**: A wrapped token representation of Bitlayer Native BTC.
- **YBTC**: A next-generation, trust-minimized Bitcoin-pegged asset. Positioned as the future of Bitcoin within the DeFi ecosystem, YBTC is slated to become the native currency for the upcoming Bitlayer Network V2 and V3 upgrades.
