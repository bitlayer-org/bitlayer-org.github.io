# Multi-Chain Architecture

Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge is designed to support multiple target chains. This means Bitcoin (BTC) can be seamlessly bridged to a diverse range of blockchain environments, each offering different applications and yielding opportunities. This capability is crucial for expanding the utility of Bitcoin in the evolving DeFi landscape.

## Univeral Liquidity

> This feature is a work in progress.

The vision for YBTC is to achieve universal liquidity across all integrated target chains. This means YBTC from one target chain will be interchangeable with YBTC on any other supported chain. Users will be able to freely transfer their YBTC between these chains, and crucially, YBTC will always be redeemable for Bitcoin, regardless of the target chain it currently resides on. (This feature is currently under development).
