# Key Differentiators of Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge

Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge incorporates several innovative features and architectural choices that set it apart, enhancing security, usability, and overall utility. Key differentiators include:

1. Flexible Peg-out:

    This feature significantly improves convenience for brokers. Brokers are allowed to initiate a withdrawal from the BitVM smart contract by directly burning their YBTC, bypassing the cumbersome self-fronting process. This innovation saves brokers valuable time and reduces their transaction costs.

2. Watcher Incentivization:

    Unlike the original BitVM2 protocol where watchers (challengers) were not directly rewarded for successful challenges, Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge implements a robust incentive mechanism. Forfeited collateral from any misbehaving broker is collected into a treasury vault. These funds are then redistributed by governance to honest participants, primarily the watchers who successfully identified and challenged malicious activity. This system not only compensates watchers for their operational expenses but also actively encourages community vigilance in monitoring bridge operations.

3. Data Availability Guarantee:

    To ensure transparency and enable effective monitoring, transaction graph data for the bridge is stored on decentralized storage, managed with support from the Bitlayer Network. This ensures that everyone can access and verify the data, and critically, that watchers have uncensorable access to the information required to perform their duties effectively.

4. Multi-chain Architecture:

    Bitlayer's BitVM Bridge is designed to support multiple target chains. This means Bitcoin (BTC) can be seamlessly bridged to a diverse range of blockchain environments, each offering different applications and yielding opportunities. This capability is crucial for expanding the utility of Bitcoin in the evolving DeFi landscape.

5. Universal Liquidity (Work In Progress):

    The vision for YBTC is to achieve universal liquidity across all integrated target chains. This means YBTC from one target chain will be interchangeable with YBTC on any other supported chain. Users will be able to freely transfer their YBTC between these chains, and crucially, YBTC will always be redeemable for Bitcoin, regardless of the target chain it currently resides on. (This feature is currently under development).

6. Maximum Accessibility (Work In Progress):

    While the original BitVM protocol was primarily designed with professional users in mind and its fixed reclaim amounts could be challenging for regular users with smaller transactions, Bitlayerâ€™s BitVM Bridge aims for broader accessibility. Although the amounts for individual reclaim operations from a BitVM instance remain fixed, brokers will be able to serve groups of users by aggregating multiple smaller peg-out requests into a single, compliant reclaim transaction. This mechanism will enable regular users to effectively withdraw smaller amounts from the bridge through the native peg-out process. (This feature is currently under development).

7. Strong Economic Incentivization (Work In Progress):

    Participant coordination and security are further enhanced through smart contracts on the Bitlayer Network. Participants will be required to stake BTR tokens to engage with the bridge. Misbehaving participants risk losing not only their collateral on Bitcoin but also their staked BTR on the Bitlayer Network. This dual-collateral system, coupled with potential penalties for actions that hinder bridge performance (like slow responses), strongly incentivizes honest behavior and contributes to the overall liveness and reliability of the bridge. (This feature is currently under development).
