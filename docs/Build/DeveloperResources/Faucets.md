# Faucets

Bitlayer is an EVM-compatible blockchain, and can enable applications and developers from the existing Ethereum ecosystem to migrate to Bitlayer at low cost, eliminating the need for substantial modifications or rewrites.

If you want to interact with the Dapps on Bitlayer Testnet, your first stop is going to be to a “faucet” to fill up your “tank”. 

Here is a faucet directly distributes Bitlayer Testnet tokens: [https://www.bitlayer.org/faucet](https://www.bitlayer.org/faucet)

It may take a few seconds for them to appear, but you can check the status by looking for a transaction for your address in [Bitlayer Explorer](https://testnet-scan.bitlayer.org).

This faucet allows developers to request 0.05 BTC test tokens for use in development and testing. You can obtain Bitlayer Testnet tokens every 24 hours for development and the testnet token has no financial value and cannot be traded at a real price.
