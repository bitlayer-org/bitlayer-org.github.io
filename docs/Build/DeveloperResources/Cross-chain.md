# Cross-chain Protocols

Several well-known general-purpose cross-chain protocols already support Bitlayer, including Chainlink CCIP and LayerZero.

## Chainlink CCIP

Chainlink CCIP is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications that can transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains. For more infomation, refer to [docs of ccip](https://docs.chain.link/ccip).

### Getting Started

There are a couple of resources to get you started building cross-chain applications with CCIP:

- [Getting started(EVM)](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/getting-started/evm)
- CCIP Directory: [CCIP Bitlayer infos](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/bitcoin-mainnet-bitlayer-1)
- [Cross-Chain Token Tutorials](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/evm/cross-chain-tokens)


## LayerZero

LayerZero delivers secure omnichain interoperability for Web3. It consists of an Oracle actor and a Relayer actor that work separately to provide secure messages from one chain to another. LayerZero's infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any connected chain, with one click.

### Getting Started

There are a couple of resources to get you started building cross-chain applications with LayerZero:

- See how to [send a LayerZero message](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/evm-guides/send-messages).
- Find examples on LayerZero's [Github](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/endpoint-v1-solidity-examples).
- Learn how to [integrate LayerZero](https://docs.layerzero.network/v1/developers/evm/evm-guides/send-messages) into your contracts and look at the deployed contracts for [Bitlayer Mainnet](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/deployments/chains/bitlayer) usage.
