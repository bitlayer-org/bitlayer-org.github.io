# Application Infrastructure

Building on blockchain from scratch is often tedious, difficult to integrate, and requires specialized knowledge. For traditional developers this can be a daunting task, and is a key obstacle to web3 adoption. Application infrastructure tools help abstract many complexities found in blockchain, such as paying for gas fees, transaction signing and confirmation, private key management, and smart contract deployment.


## Owl Protocol

[Owl Protocol](https://owlprotocol.xyz) is a complete, gasless API for web3 and smart wallets. The platform allows anyone to integrate or build entire products on the blockchain without private keys or crypto, making Web3 truly accessible for any developer.

### API features

- Seamless, familiar API development without gas fees or obtrusive signing requests.
- Social logins and API key or JWT-based authentication for back-end or client-side interactions.
- Fully integrated with a dashboard to allow your entire team to create new projects, monitor usage, and manage your app or integration.
