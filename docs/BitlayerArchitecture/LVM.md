# Layered Virtual Machine (LVM)

Layered Virtual Machine (LVM) technology represents a significant advancement in terms of smart contract execution. This innovative approach enables the support of various frontend smart contract types, such as EVM/CairoVM, and backend zero-knowledge proof verifiers, including ZK-STARKs and ZK-SNARKs (Groth16, PLONK, etc.), while maintaining robust security measures and enhancing computational flexibility.

Supporting multiple frontend smart contract types can easily attract developers from various blockchain ecosystems. For instance, EVM is a widely used smart contract platform with its own bytecode and execution environment. By integrating support for EVM within the LVM framework, developers can leverage existing EVM-based smart contracts seamlessly while also benefiting from enhanced execution capabilities provided by the layered architecture.

On the backend side, supporting various zero-knowledge proof generators provides more optimization possibilities for the disputing process without compromising existing functionalities. In the future, when more succinct and efficient zero-knowledge proof systems emerge, Bitlayer's flexibility will allow for quick adaptation essential for keeping pace with evolving blockchain standards, emerging technologies, and changing user requirements.
