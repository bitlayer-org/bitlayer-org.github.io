| Solidity version supported | â‰¤ 0.8.25 |  |
| Geth json-rpc compatibility | Fully support but with `eth_feeHistory` disabled | Can use `eth_feeHistory2` instead, <br/>because there's some issue for Metamask users when priority fee per gas is less than `1 gwei`, and we want to avoid our users spending unnecessary high fee. |
