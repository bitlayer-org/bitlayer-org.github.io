## Gas Price

### Bitlayer
Bitlayer aims to offer lower transaction costs through innovative efficiency mechanisms. Leveraging technologies like optimistic execution, Bitlayer seeks to optimize transaction throughput, making it a potentially more economical choice for its users.

:::caution **Important: About Gas Price on Bitlayer**

Bitlayer's native gas token is BTC, utilized with an 18-digit precision, diverging from Bitcoin's traditional 8-digit precision. This adjustment aligns with the default decimal precision of tokens on EVM-compatible chains, ensuring consistency across transactions.
:::
To accommodate transaction processing priorities, Bitlayer has established a minimum priority fee requirement. Developers can dynamically estimate the required gas price for transactions using `eth_gasPrice` or `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`.

For transactions on the Mainnet/Testnet, a minimum tip of 0.05 gwei is necessary. Typically, setting a `gasPrice` of `0.0500001 gwei` for legacy transactions or a `maxPriorityFeePerGas` of `0.05 gwei` (with an adequately set `maxFeePerGas`) for EIP-1559 transactions should suffice for most operations.

Dapp developers are advised to programmatically set the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` before initiating transactions via APIs, rather than relying on default strategies employed by wallets (like MetaMask) or SDKs, to ensure optimal transaction processing.

### Ethereum
In contrast, Ethereum's gas prices fluctuate based on network demand. Users compete for computational resources, leading to variable gas prices that can spike significantly during periods of high demand, affecting cost-effectiveness.

## Supported EVM and Solidity Versions

### Bitlayer

#### EVM Support
Bitlayer is fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts. It supports EVM-compatible contracts up to the Cancun update, with the exception of the PREVRANDAO opcode, BLOBHASH opcode, and BLOBBASEFEE opcode. This enables developers to build applications on Bitcoin's secure network, mirroring the functionality available on Ethereum.

#### Solidity Version
Currently, Bitlayer supports Solidity up to version v0.8.28, with a commitment to incorporating future versions. This stance ensures that developers have access to a stable and secure environment for their smart contracts.

### Ethereum

#### EVM Support
Ethereum, as the origin of the EVM, offers support for the entire range of EVM functionalities. This allows for a wide spectrum of smart contract capabilities and decentralized application developments.

#### Solidity Version
Ethereum consistently supports the latest versions of Solidity, providing developers with the newest features, optimizations, and security enhancements for smart contract development.

## Implications

### For Developers

- **Bitlayer** emerges as an appealing platform for developers seeking to leverage Bitcoin's renowned security with the added benefit of potentially lower operational costs. The compatibility with EVM ensures a smooth transition for developers already familiar with Ethereum's ecosystem.
- **Ethereum** remains a cornerstone for smart contract and decentralized application development, supported by its extensive tooling and a vibrant community.

### For Users

- **Bitlayer** offer more cost-effective interactions with decentralized applications, backed by the security of Bitcoin. This makes it an attractive platform for users prioritizing security and efficiency.
- **Ethereum** offers a broad and diverse ecosystem of dApps.

In essence, Bitlayer introduces a strategic approach to integrating smart contract functionality within Bitcoin's secure and cost-effective framework, offering tangible benefits for both developers and users.
