# About Gas

## Important: about gas price
- Bitlayer's native gas token is BTC. However, on Bitlayer, BTC has an 18-digit precision, which is different from the 8-digit precision of BTC on Bitcoin. This is done to maintain consistency with the default decimal of tokens of EVM-compatible chains.

- On the Bitlayer, there is a minimum priority fee requirement. Developers can use `eth_gasPrice` or `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` to estimate the gas price required for a transaction in real time.

- For the Mainnet/Testnet, a minimum tip of `0.025 gwei` is required. Usually, `0.0250001 gwei` `gasPrice` for legacy transactions, `0.025 gwei` `maxPriorityFeePerGas` (and set enough amount to `maxFeePerGas`) for EIP1559 transactions SHOULD BE enough.

- For Dapp developers, it's recommended that setting the `maxPriorityFeePerGas` by code before calling apis to send the transaction, rather then leave it empty (filled by the default strategy of wallet (e.g. Metamask) or SDK).
