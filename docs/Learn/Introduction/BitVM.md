# About BitVM

[BitVM](https://bitvm.org/) is a computing paradigm to express Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts,which is the fundamental pillar for building a native Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, without softfork or hardfork(which would take years), BitVM allows developers to verify computations on Bitcoin.

## What is BitVM?

BitVM is invented by [Robin Linus](https://x.com/robin_linus/) from ZeroSync, BitVM offers a novel computing paradigm designed specifically for the Bitcoin blockchain. This initiative was launched in late 2023 to enable more expressive contracts and efficient off-chain computations without necessitating soft forks.

Unlike Ethereum, BitVM's aim is not replication but expansion, enhancing Bitcoin's capabilities to handle increased demand. This becomes increasingly important as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows, especially with upcoming events like Bitcoin halving and the rising interest from institutional investors following Bitcoin ETFs.

BitVM's features include the optimistic validation of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups—similar to technologies used in Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions—which process transactions off-chain to reduce mainnet congestion. These transactions are finalized on the mainnet, incorporating mechanisms to deter and identify potential fraud.

## Benefits of BitVM

- **Optimistic Validation of ZK Rollups**: BitVM facilitates the validation of ZK rollups directly on the Bitcoin network, allowing complex layer 2 computations without changing Bitcoin's consensus rules or compromising blockchain performance.

- **Bridging Sidechains and Rollups to Bitcoin**: It aims to create more decentralized bridges between Bitcoin and layer 2 platforms like Rootstock, reducing reliance on intermediaries and lowering the risk of fraud.

- **Reduced Transaction Fees**: BitVM could significantly lower Bitcoin transaction fees by managing data and computations off-chain. This can help mitigate spikes in fees, like those seen in December 2023, when they reached $38.43.

- **Enhanced Security**: By focusing on two-party contracts, BitVM enhances security over systems that handle multi-party contracts, as is common with Ethereum. It provides mechanisms to prove and dispute fraudulent transactions effectively.
