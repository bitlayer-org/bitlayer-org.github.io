# About Bitlayer
For users and developers alike, the fundamental concept of Bitlayer is outlined below:

![intro](/img/Introduction/intro.png)

Bitlayer acts as a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, boasting **100% EVM and Ethereum toolchain compatibility**, with BTC as native token(gas token).

:::tip Note on Solidity Version Support:

We currently support Solidity up to version v0.8.28. Updates for newer versions might be delayed. 

:::

Users can engage with it using wallets such as **Metamask, imToken, or other Ethereum-compatible wallets**.

Developers are afforded the ease of migrating smart contracts written in **Solidity, Vyper, or any other language that compiles to EVM bytecode** directly to Bitlayer, using the toolchain you are familiar with: **Ethereum JSON-RPC, Hardhat**, etc.
