### Explore Bitlayer Technical Documentation

Bitlayer is the first Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, offering Bitcoin-equivalent security and Turing completeness. It is also the first Bitcoin Layer 2 solution based on BitVM paradigm. Bitlayer aims to enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem by providing secure scalability, promoting diversity of assets, and encouraging innovation. Ultimately, it seeks to offer users a faster, safer, and more flexible experience.

### Why Choose Bitlayer?

At Bitlayer, our primary focus is to address the scalability challenges of the Bitcoin network.

While Bitcoin remains the leading blockchain for value transfer, it faces limitations in terms of scalability and transaction costs. Bitlayer tackles these issues head-on by leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic protocols and virtual machine technology. Bitlayer is building a native Bitcoin Layer 2 using BitVM paradigm, it will achieve Bitcoin finality, trustless bridge, multiple virtual machine support. This means that developers can easily migrate their existing smart contracts written in Solidity, Vyper, or any other language that compiles to EVM bytecode directly to Bitlayer, using familiar tools such as Ethereum JSON-RPC and Hardhat.

The ingenious integration of Bitcoin smart contracts and Ethereum compatibility sets Bitlayer apart, verifying the integrity of Bitlayer's transactions and ensuring a high level of security, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. These achievements are made possible through recent advancements in cryptography, blockchain protocol design, and hardware optimization.

For detailed insights into our technical architecture, please refer to the [Bitlayer Technical Architecture section](/docs/Learn/Introduction/TechnicalArchitecture).


### Can I Start Using Bitlayer Today?

According to our [roadmap](/docs/Learn/Introduction/Roadmap), we, the Bitlayer Mainnet-V1 has launched and we are also glad to offer a testnet environment where you can experiment with Bitlayer's capabilities. Please refer to our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/Build/GettingStarted/QuickStart) to get started with our test network and explore the infinite possibilities of Bitcoin on both Bitlayer Testnet and Mainnet.

### What Lies Ahead for Bitlayer?
We have launched the Bitlayer Mainnet-V1 in early April, our journey to further security&decentralization is far from over. We are committed to decentralizing each component of the stack, ensuring a resilient and robust network.
