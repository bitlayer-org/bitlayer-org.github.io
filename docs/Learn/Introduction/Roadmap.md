# Roadmap
The vision of Bitlayer will be realized through the rollout of a mainnet in multiple stages, with each phase designed to enhance the user experience and bolster security through cryptographic proof of Bitcoin consensus and onchain activity.

## First Stage: Bitlayer PoS
In this initial phase, Bitlayer adopts the best security model: PoS + Multisig, working with multiple MPC custody platforms, utilizing 100% EVM-Compatible environment to onboard users and developers.

Bitlayer PoS supports the cross-chain movement between BTC/EVM/Other Blockchains and Bitlayer, thereby enriching the overall value of the Bitlayer ecosystem.

During this stage, we will prioritize offering a 100% EVM-compatible development kit and ecosystem support, enabling developers to quickly build, test, and deploy applications on Bitlayer. Solidity applications can be seamlessly migrated, providing early users with the benefits of low gas fees and an extensible Bitcoin framework.

## Second Stage: Bitcoin Finality-V1[WIP]

In this phase, we plan to introduce a rollup-equivalent model, implement a BitVM component for committing and challenging the state transition, achieving the capability for L1 verification.

By leveraging the vast network and security of Bitcoin, Bitlayer will continuously lead with the highest security standards, offering users enhanced flexibility and an improved onchain experience through network upgrades.

## Third Stage: Bitcoin Finality-V2[WIP]
In this phase, our aim is to implement trustless bridge based on the L1 verification ability.

Upon the completion of this third stage, Bitlayer’s final mainnet will be fully deployed, achieving the network's original goals—Bitcoin-equivalent security combined with Turing completeness. 

This version is set to raise the security standards of Bitcoin Layer 2 to an unprecedented level.
